# Business Problem
The business problem we encountered was to investigate whether there was a significant difference in the revenues between the variant and control groups. By understanding this problem, we formulated a hypothesis that helped us guide our analysis.

# Data Understanding
Before diving into the analysis, we first looked at the data and summarized it to gain a better understanding of what we were dealing with. During this process, we also detected and resolved problems in the data, such as missing values, outliers, and unexpected values.

# Hypothesis Testing
After understanding the business problem and cleaning the data, we applied hypothesis testing to determine if there was a significant difference in the revenues between the variant and control groups. To do this, we first checked for normality and homogeneity assumptions and applied tests such as Shapiro, Levene, T-Test, Welch Test, and Mann Whitney U Test.

# Results
Our analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the revenues of the variant and control groups. This finding helped us make a recommendation for the business decision.
